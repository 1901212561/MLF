## Course overview

With the advent of computation power and big data, machine learning recently became one of the most spotlighted research field in industry and academia. This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning in theoretical and practical perspectives. Through this course, students will learn the intuition and implementation behind the popular machine learning methods and gain hands-on experience of using ML software packages such as SK-learn and Tensorflow. This course will also explore the possibility of applying ML to finance and business. Each student is required to complete a final course project. 

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate-level knowledge in probability/statistics and previous experience in programming language (python) is highly recommended.
